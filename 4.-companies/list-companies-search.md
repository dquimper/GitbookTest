## List Companies (Search)

```POST https://api.prosperworks.com/developer_api/v1/companies/search```

The /search endpoint provides the ability to list Companies and sort the results by certain parameters. When multiple ciriteria are provided records meeting ALL criteria will be returned (the filtering criteria have an 'AND' relationship).

To see examples of search request using the various parameters, click on the `Companies Search` dropdown on the right. Certain fields can be filtered by an empty value, i.e., filter records where the field is not specified. For Companies, these fields are: city, state, postal_code, tags, custom dropdown, custom multi-select fields. For an example of how this works, see `Search Companies by Empty Field`. Some fields (e.g. assignee_ids) can also filter for an empty value by specifying -2 as the ID.

To search by custom fields, see `Search Entity by Custom Field` under `Custom Fields` folder.

To change the number of records returned, change the "page_size" parameter. E.g., specify 200 for a page size of 200 records.

## UPSERT a Lead

```PUT https://api.prosperworks.com/developer_api/v1/leads/upsert```

**Functionality**

"Upsert" (update + insert) will atomically do the following:
1. Check for the existence of a Lead matching certain criteria
1. If one exists, update it with the supplied parameters.
1. If not, create a new Lead with the supplied parameters.
1. This is particularly useful to avoid creating duplicate Leads.

**Match Criteria**

The supported match criteria are:
* Name
* Email
* Custom Fields

To match on a Custom Field, the corresponding Custom Field Definition must be available on Leads and included in filters. (These settings may be viewed and edited in the web application via System Settings -> Custom Fields.)

**Match Outcomes**

Match outcomes are handled as follows:

* If no matches are found, create a new Lead.
* If exactly one match is found, update that Lead.
* If more than one match is found, return a 422 response with the IDs of the matching Leads.
* If more than 30 matches are found, return a 422 response without the IDs of the matching Leads.
